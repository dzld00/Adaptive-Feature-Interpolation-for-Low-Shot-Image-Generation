# Usage:
### Adaptive Feature Interpolation
Create a batch of new features from a batch of old features: 
```
new_feature = near_interp(old_feature, k, augment_prob) 
```
where k, augment_prob can be generated by function `dynamic_prob` or defined by user. Please refer to `interp_feature.py` for more details. Example of implementation in StyleGAN2 can be found in the corresponding folder.
